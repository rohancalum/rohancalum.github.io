                <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 200">
                    In the summer of 2018, I was hired to kick-start data science efforts for the University of British
                    Columbia's Sustainability Office. However, I found it difficult
                    to find and access the datasets I needed. To solve this, I designed and led my team to launch an
                    open data portal (built using <a href="https://getdkan.org/" target="_blank">DKAN</a>).
                    The platform now serves various sustainability-related datasets managed by the university to the
                    public.

                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 200">Don't hesitate to speak up and seek clarification
                        early when things don't make sense.</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 200">Ensure everyone is using the same vocabulary (and
                        dictionary) in meetings.</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 200">More demos, less words. A prototype or wireframe is
                        the most efficient way of explaining the value of a new tool or service.</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 200">Sayre's law and the incentive/power structures of
                        public institutions can stifle operational efficiency and make innovation harder. The solution
                        is probably more demos, less words.</li>

                    People who have experienced its consequences. I've long been an advocate for strong education
                    systems (I mean, who isn't?). Aside from <a
                        href="https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1982APb.pdf" target="_blank">chance
                        encounters</a>, they are probably the single most important
                    determinant of life paths. Yet, when was the last time you were asked for your perspective on how
                    Grade 10 could be improved? When I heard that <a href="https://letstalkscience.ca/"
                        target="_blank">Let's Talk Science</a> was consulting K-12 students across the country for their
                    <a href="https://canada2067.ca/en/" target="_blank">Canada 2067</a> initiative,
                    I felt the need to ensure post-secondary students and young professionals could provide their input.
                    After all, hindsight is 20/20. As a member of the World Economic Forum Global Shapers Community, I
                    coordinated roundtable discussions with over 200 young people from around the country. The outcomes
                    were presented to around 500 educational leaders and stakeholders.

                </h2>
                <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 200">
                    In high school, I'd sometimes hear classmates speak poorly of homeless youth. This bothered me, so I
                    worked with the City of Edmonton and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4532152/"
                        target="_blank">Akash Sherman</a> to try and change perspectives.
                    We collaborated with local community service organizations for months, and partnered with five
                    incredible youth to share their experiences through film. The plan was for this to seed profound
                    change, but we fell short. Many kids are still stuck in systemic homelessness.
                    This work left much to be desired, but I hope by sharing it new conversations and ideas can be
                    sparked. You can watch the full film <a href="https://vimeo.com/115991770" target="_blank">here</a>.
