    <p> I am a graduate student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alberta. 
		Previously, I was a research assistant with the <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/etalab/">Energy, 
		Technology and Architecture Lab</a> at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I worked on 
		machine learning models to understand the impacts of climate change on the built environment. I also  
		launched a sustainability open data portal for the university. </p>
