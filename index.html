	<h1>Rohan Nuttall</h1>
	<p>I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alberta. 
		I'm interested in how reinforcement learning, explainable artificial intelligence and 
		<a href="https://www.computational-sustainability.org/">computational sustainability</a> can 
		help us build better societies. I'm also interested in the economics of inequality,
		<a href="http://openroboethics.org/">roboethics</a> and mitigating bad climate change impacts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously, I interned with <a href="https://www.kindred.ai/">Kindred Systems</a> and was a
		research assistant with the <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/etalab/">Energy, Technology and 
		Architecture Lab</a> at the University of British Columbia (UBC). There, I worked on machine 
		learning models to understand the impacts of future climate change on the built environment. 
		I also launched a sustainability <a href="https://data.sustain.ubc.ca/">open data portal</a> 
		for the university.
	</p>
	<p>Before this, I loved exploring the world of physics. I had the priviledge of working at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/">TRIUMF</a> on experimental
		particle physics with the <a href="https://pienu.triumf.ca/">PIENU collaboration</a>, as well 
		as on radioisotope production with the Accelerator Division.
