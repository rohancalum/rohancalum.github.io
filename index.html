				<p> I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning and 
				Artificial Intelligence Lab</a> at the University of Alberta. My research interests center around two questions: 
				<ul>
					<li>How can agents best learn reward and world models of/from human preferences? Can agents learn to distinguish good from bad?</li>
					<li>What roles can reinforcement learning play in mitigating climate change impacts and <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/" target="_blank">improving
						institutional decision making?</a></li>

			I'm also interested in equitable education, <a href="http://openroboethics.org/" target="_blank">roboethics</a>, 
			and how technology can help improve biodiversity, conservation and livelihoods. To this end, on weekends I help with writing software for 
			<a href="http://ubhub.org/aboutUs" target="_blank">Urban Biodiversity Hub</a> and <a href="https://www.ironandearth.org/" target="_blank">Iron & Earth</a>. 
			Previously, I interned with <a href="https://www.kindred.ai/" target="_blank">Kindred Systems</a> and was a
			research assistant with the <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/etalab/" target="_blank">Energy, Technology and 
			Architecture Lab</a> at the University of British Columbia (UBC). There, I worked on machine 
			learning models to understand the impacts of future climate change on the built environment. 
			I also launched a sustainability <a href="https://data.sustain.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">open data portal</a> 
			for the university.
		</p>
		<p> Before this, I enjoyed exploring the world of physics at UBC. I learned about the complexities of producing radioisotopes at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">TRIUMF</a>, as well as how elegant
			particle physics experiments are designed with the <a href="https://pienu.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">PIENU collaboration</a>.

	<p>(I like to volunteer and consult for organizations that are working on sustainability challenges. Whether that is building
