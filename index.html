	<h1>Rohan Nuttall</h1>
	<p>I am a graduate student with the <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">Reinforcement and Artificial Intelligent Lab</a> at the University of Alberta. My research focusses on 
		how planning, causality, and model-based learning can improve the success of real-world applications of reinforcement learning. 
		I'm interested in how these techniques, as well as eplainable artificial intelligence and 
		<a href="https://www.computational-sustainability.org/" target="_blank">computational sustainability</a> can 
		help us build better societies. I'm also interested in the economics of inequality,
		<a href="http://openroboethics.org/" target="_blank">roboethics</a>, mitigating climate change impacts, and how technology, 
		data and strategy can help improve biodiversity, conservation and livelihoods.
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously, I interned with <a href="https://www.kindred.ai/" target="_blank">Kindred Systems</a> and was a
		research assistant with the <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/etalab/" target="_blank">Energy, Technology and 
		Architecture Lab</a> at the University of British Columbia (UBC). There, I worked on machine 
		learning models to understand the impacts of future climate change on the built environment. 
		I also launched a sustainability <a href="https://data.sustain.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">open data portal</a> 
		for the university.
	</p>
	<p>Before this, I enjoyed exploring the world of physics. I learned about the complexities of producing radioisotopes at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">TRIUMF</a>, as well as how elegant
		particle physics experiments are designed with the <a href="https://pienu.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">PIENU collaboration</a>. 
	</p>
	
<!-- 
	<p>(I like to volunteer and consult for organizations that are working on sustainability challenges. Whether that is building 
		a career transition portal for Iron & Earth, city biodiversity indicator platform for the Urban Biodiversity Hub, psychological bias
		framing tools for ClimateMind or machine learning models for companies focussed on the post-carbon transition)
